mark_shared_branches!(MCC::Union{Nothing, Vector{Vector{String}}}, trees::Vararg{Tree})

Add a `shared_branch` parameter to all `trees`, branches with a `shared_branch` do not have a recombination event 
occuring on them as they connect clades that should be together according to the MCCs. If trees are not fully resolved 
and two mccs share a common ancestor this ancestor will be marked as `None` by the `assign_mccs!` function. If the 
`up_to_resolution` flag is used branches leading to such a shared node will still be marked as `shared_branch` 
(i.e. node.anc's `mcc` is marked as `None` but node has a sister with the same `mcc`).

The function proceeds by allocating each node to the MCC it should be in using the Fitch algorithm, 
then branches which are in a MCC with 2 or more nodes are marked with `shared_branch`.
